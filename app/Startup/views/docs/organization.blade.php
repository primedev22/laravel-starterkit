<h1>Organization</h1>
<p>
    This is a work in progress but at this time most of the core of LaravelStartup can be found in
    `app\Startup`. This means, Controllers, Models, Events, Listeners, Middleware, views, and even migrations
    can all be found in that folder. After that, however you want to organize the core of your app
    is up to you.
